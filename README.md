# Smart Agriculture DevSecOps 

Smart Agriculture DevSecOps Project

This project showcases a secure, scalable, and automated infrastructure for a smart agriculture platform. It is designed to simulate how DevSecOps best practices can be applied in a multi-cloud, sensor-driven environment that prioritizes real-time data collection, secure data pipelines, and compliance.

📆 Project Goal

To design and deploy an end-to-end infrastructure for a smart agriculture use case, leveraging DevSecOps principles:

Automate provisioning using Terraform & Ansible

Ensure secure CI/CD using GitHub Actions

Containerize and deploy apps with Docker & Kubernetes (EKS)

Implement monitoring, logging, and compliance

🚀 Technologies Used

Terraform (modular IaC)

AWS (EC2, VPC, RDS, EKS, IAM, CloudWatch)

GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipelines)

Ansible (configuration automation)

Docker & Kubernetes (EKS)

Datadog & Prometheus/Grafana (monitoring)

HashiCorp Vault (secrets management)

tfsec / OPA (policy as code)

🧵 Architecture Overview

A high-level system diagram includes:

IoT sensor data streaming to a secure API layer

Backend services on EKS

PostgreSQL (RDS) for data storage

Terraform for multi-cloud IaC provisioning

GitHub Actions + tfsec for secure CI/CD

Vault for secret injection

See /diagrams/ folder for visual

🔹 DevSecOps Concepts Demonstrated

Infrastructure as Code with reusable Terraform modules

Security baked into pipelines (static analysis, IaC scanning)

Container orchestration using Kubernetes (EKS)

Vault-based secret injection into apps & pipelines

Cloud-native observability with Datadog and CloudWatch

IAM & Network policy hardening (NSGs, SGs, WAFs)

📅 Key Features

✅ One-command provisioning of the full stack (IaC)

✅ Enforced security policies at deploy time

✅ Auto-scaling EKS cluster for agriculture microservices

✅ Real-time monitoring and logging dashboards

⚖️ Setup Instructions

# Clone repo
$ git clone https://github.com/Jnr-Neba/smart-agriculture-devsecops.git

# Navigate
$ cd smart-agriculture-devsecops

# Provision infra (example)
$ terraform init && terraform apply

# Ansible provision (optional)
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml

Note: AWS credentials must be configured prior.

🚮 Security Considerations

S3 buckets are private and encrypted

IAM roles use least privilege

Secrets are never hardcoded

tfsec blocks insecure IaC changes

WAF blocks common threats (e.g. OWASP top 10)

📊 Potential Impact (Simulated Metrics)

⏱ Reduced environment setup time by 30%

🛡️ Prevented 95%+ of critical misconfigurations pre-deployment

🔍 Improved system observability by 60%, reducing MTTR

🚀 Improved release speed by 3x through secure CI/CD

📘 Challenges & Solutions

Challenge: Enforcing security in fast-paced CI/CD

Solution: Integrated tfsec, policy-as-code, and GitHub secret scanners pre-merge

Challenge: Cross-team buy-in on DevSecOps

Solution: Built developer-friendly workflows and conducted security onboarding sessions
